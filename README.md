Garage Fob
==========

Simple NodeJS web application, backed by some hardware for opening a garage door.  Crazy!

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this app is to allow web-based access via a mobile phone to gain entry to
a garage secured by a radio fob.  Fob's are often in short supply, and expensive to replace,
so this project aims to implement a simple web-based keypad, backed by some hardware
for activating the fob to open the garage door.
